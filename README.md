# My_First_Project
Sample project for learning phyton for data science

Welcome to my first data analysis project with Python. In this project I use the main libraries for data science such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas and Scikit-learn.

This project focuses on data analysis using the tools mentioned above. Throughout the notebooks provided, I explore the different aspects of the dataset and how these libraries facilitate data manipulation, visualization and modeling.
